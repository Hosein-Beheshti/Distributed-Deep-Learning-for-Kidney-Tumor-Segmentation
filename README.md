# Distributed-Deep-Learning-for-Kidney-Tumor-Segmentation
Implementing and experimenting with the effects of parallel processing over a single node, multi-GPUs, and distributed
learning across multiple nodes on a cluster.

Achieving a 3.15 times speedup through distributed learning over 4 nodes, with a single GPU on each, where the batch
size is large enough.
